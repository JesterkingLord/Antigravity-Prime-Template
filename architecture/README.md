# 🏛️ Layer 1: Architecture (SOPs)

## 📌 Purpose
This directory contains the **Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)** and high-level strategies that define *how* the system behaves.

### 📜 Contents
- **System Rules**: Directives on data handling, security, and logging.
- **Business Logic**: Definitions of workflows (e.g., "User Onboarding", "Content Generation").
- **Constraints**: Hard limits on what the agent can and cannot do.

## 🔗 Connection
- **Inputs**: Received from `navigation/` (Layer 2).
- **Outputs**: Passed to `tools/` (Layer 3) for execution.

*This layer is purely strategic. No executable code lives here.*
