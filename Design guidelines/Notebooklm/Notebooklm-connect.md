## 1. Connect Antigravity to NotebookLM

Copy and paste the below 👇

Install and set up the NotebookLM MCP server for me:

1. Install the notebooklm-mcp-server package using uv (or pip if uv isn't available)
2. Add it to my MCP configuration file (usually at ~/.config/opencode/opencode.json or similar)
3. Run the authentication command (notebooklm-mcp-auth) and open a browser to authorize it
4. Verify the installation is working by listing my NotebookLM notebooks

Make sure to:

- Use the correct installation method for my system
- Configure the MCP server properly in my config file
- Guide me through the browser authentication process
- Confirm everything is working at the end
- You must add this here once completed: @mcp_config.json
- You may need to make sure the user is signed out of their browser before doing this.
